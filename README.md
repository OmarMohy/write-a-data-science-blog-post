## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using this data which was a sample of data from an interview task about online booking platform in a travel agency to find the below gather some insights and answer some question I am interested in like the below :

1. What are the top nationalities in the dataset that gets confirmed requests or makes requests in general?
2. Does people like to travel in groups or alone?
3. Does price affects clients confirmation?
4. Does duration of travel affects clients confirmation?
5. How well can we predict a clients confirmation?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions. It is a very small data around 1000 observation.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@joshua.chyeung/go-to-the-western-world-if-you-are-a-programmer-1ccfac7e413a).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

This data was from a specific company for a data analysis interview task. The data doesn't relate to the nature of the company, but it is preferable data not to be shared. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
